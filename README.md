# Line-Follower-Robot
A line follower robot is a type of robot that is designed to follow a line, either a physical line on the ground or a digital line on a screen. The robot typically uses sensors, such as infrared or optical sensors, to detect the line and adjust its movements accordingly. The objective of a line follower robot is to move along the line without deviating from it or losing track of it.

Line follower robots are often used in industrial automation, where they can be used to move materials along a production line or transport goods within a warehouse. They can also be used in educational settings, as they provide a hands-on way for students to learn about robotics, sensors, and programming.

The design of a line follower robot can vary depending on the specific application and environment. Some robots are designed to be small and agile, while others are larger and more robust. Some robots use wheels or tracks for movement, while others use legs or other types of locomotion.

To program a line follower robot, the robot must be able to interpret the data from its sensors and adjust its movements accordingly. This can be accomplished using a variety of programming languages and platforms, such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi. The programming typically involves creating a set of instructions or algorithms that tell the robot how to respond to different sensor readings.

Overall, line follower robots are a useful and versatile type of robot that can be used in a variety of applications. They provide a practical way to teach robotics and programming, and they are an important tool in industrial automation and logistics.
